<h1>Code Reviews</h1>
While reviewing code made by you or your colleagues there are generally a questions you can ask yourself about the code.

1. Am I able to **understand** the code easily?
2. Is the code written following the **coding standards** and **guidelines**?
3. Is the same code **duplicated** more than twice?
4. Can I **unit test/ debug** the code easily to find the root cause?
5. Is this function or class **too big**? If yes, is the function or class doing **too much**?

If you find the answer is yes to any of the above questions then you can leave a comment with a suggestion of what to *alter* or *change*.
